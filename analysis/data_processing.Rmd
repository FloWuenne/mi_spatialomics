# Molecular Cartography

## Processing of raw data

The raw Molecular Cartography data was processed using the [nf-core/molkart](https://nf-co.re/molkart) pipeline (revision: 81eafe9f9993d4daf16371ba3804ce9ae08053ad). The configurations, parameters and models used to reproduce the processing can be found in Synapse in the following location:

[/Molecular_Cartography/nfcore_molkart](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn53251662)

All downstream processing after nf-core/molkart was performed in R and python using scripts provided and documented in this repository. See [Data processing](./analysis/data_processing.Rmd) for details.
