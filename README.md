# Introduction

Add Abstract text.

# Repository contents

This repository was created using [workflowR](https://workflowr.github.io/workflowr/index.html) to ensure reproducibility and accessibility. The repository contains description and links for processing of raw imaging data using nextflow pipelines. For downstream, data analysis, the repo contains a mix of Rmarkdown scripts, as well as Jupyter notebooks for data analysis. Since WorkflowR is geared towards Rmarkdown, the Jupyter notebooks can be viewed directly on Github
